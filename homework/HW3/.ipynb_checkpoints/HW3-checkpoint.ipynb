There is the short or *relative* path, which is given from where this notebook is (homework/HW3). In such paths, to go up, one uses two periods. So, \"..\" means the parent of HW3, which is homework, and \"../..\" is the github repo root.\n",

Since we are going for phonemes, you can ignore any tokens not in the CMU dictionary, including punctuation. Your tokenizer should examine the CMU dictionary and return a list of tokens, where each token is the CMU pronunciation for that word. If the word has multiple pronunciations, choose the first. If the word isn't in the dictionary, just ignore it."
